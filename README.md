# Project Abstract
This project proposes a machine learning empowered pill dispenser that will allow both caregivers and patients to have peace of mind as they partake in what for most of them is a daily requirement for their health and safety. This pill dispensing software will allow for medications to always be dispensed with only the needed medications and dosages based on the facial recognition of the patient attempting to get their medication. This will allow patients to get their medication without the struggle of opening or sorting through pill bottles and help prevent the possibility of an overdose on medications by no longer having patients access of all their medicine supply at the same time. Moreover, caregivers will be able to access data regarding the frequency and timing of when/if their patients take their medications which will help inform their care.
